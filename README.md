# Fundamentals of Data Structures Labs

This repository contains lab assignments and practical programs for the "Fundamentals of Data Structures" course. The assignments are implemented in both Python and C++, covering a variety of data structures and algorithms concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **Python Assignments**
  - `Assingment1.py`: Set operations without using built-in set functions (Cricket, Badminton, Football problem)
  - `Assingment2.py`: Marks analysis (average, highest/lowest, absent count, highest frequency)
  - `Assingment3.py`: Matrix operations, sorting, and sports grouping (menu-driven)
  - `Assingment4.py`: Insertion and Shell sort for student percentages
  - `Assingment5.py`: Selection and Bubble sort for student percentages
  - `Assingment6.py`: Matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose

- **C++ Assignments**
  - `Assingment7.cpp`: Singly linked list operations (club members management)
  - `Assingment8.cpp`: Doubly circular linked list (Cinemax seat booking system)
  - `Assingment9.cpp`: Stack operations (reverse string, palindrome check)
  - `Assingment10.cpp`: Stack-based parenthesis matching
  - `Assingment11.cpp`: Queue implementation (job queue simulation)
  - `Assingment12.cpp`: Queue implementation (job queue simulation, alternate version)
  - `Assingment13.cpp`: Deque (double-ended queue) implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (for `.py` files)
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, for `.cpp` files)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library for Python matrix operations (`pip install numpy`)

### Running Python Assignments

```sh
python Assingment1.py
# or
python Assingment2.py
# etc.
```

### Compiling and Running C++ Assignments

```sh
g++ Assingment7.cpp -o ass7
./ass7
```
Repeat for other `.cpp` files as needed.

## Notes

- File names use the spelling "Assingment" for consistency with the provided files.
- Each assignment is self-contained and can be run independently.
- For C++ programs, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++` on macOS/Linux or MinGW on Windows).
- For Python programs involving matrices, install NumPy if not already present.
